# Project Three

Submission Date: 8 November 2017

The MatrixEntry class stores data and links for each element in matrix.

The SparseIntMatrix class provides the basic functionality of a matrix 
using a linked list structure and the MatrixEntry class. 

The SparseIntMatrix class tests the implemented sparse int matrix using
three provided text files, which then prints an image based on data within 
the matrices. 

## Files Created by Connor Hanlon
  * MatrixEntry.java

## Key Takeaways
  * Implementation of a 2D linked sparse matrix
  * Linking data entries, tracking of specific elements, and
  iterating through linked lists
  * Analysis of an implemented structure in terms of space
  efficiency and memory usage
