# Project One

Submission Date: 28 September 2017

Grade: 96/100

Circle, rectangle, and triangle classes were implemented with similar methods.
-Note: An interface was not used as at this point in the course, as the I didn't know
about them at this point in the course. 

Using the shape classes, a program was written that draws fractals of said shapes.

Key features immplemented in ProjectFractal:
  * asked the user for input with shape choices 
  * draw fractal based on chosen pattern
  * compute total area of fractals and print result to screen once finished drawing
