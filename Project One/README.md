# Project One

Submission Date: 28 September 2017

Circle, rectangle, and triangle classes were implemented with similar methods.
-Note: An interface was not used as at this point in the course, as the I didn't know
about them at this point in the course. 

Using the shape classes, a program was written that draws fractals of said shapes.

Key features implemented in ProjectFractal:
  * asked the user for input with shape choices 
  * draw fractal based on chosen pattern
  * compute total area of fractals and print result to screen once finished drawing

## Files Created by Connor Hanlon
* Circle.java
* Triangle.java
* Rectangle.java
* ProjectFractal.java

## Key Takeaways
 * Requesting information from a user with the use of Scanner
 * Basic use of objects, methods, and stored information
 * Reading, understanding, and using classes made by other users
